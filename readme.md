#DAZZLE

#### Why

I believe that most real time cross platform animation/interactivty engines are too complicated these days, meaning we
are actually seeing less output from relatively non technical creatives than we should be. This is an attempt to make
something very lightweight, but also allow publishing too all platforms (web + ios/android native) in real time (quickly
being able to know if your project is working is an essential feedback mechanism for the creative process)

Think Flash for today (once the tooling is built around the engine)

Think your own instagram stories engine.

### hello world

- npm i razzle-dazzle -g
- dazzle startproject <project_name>
- cd <project_name>
- dazzle runserver

open localhost:4242

### A quick word on trees

TBA

#### What?

In the new project folder you will have created, you will find 2 things: A component folder & index.json file

##### Entities

In the index.js

##### Components

As with many systems these days, a "component" model is used. A component is potential collection of code/logic/styling/anything.
Components are attached to "Entities"
